# JAVA TEMPLATE
A java template that has SPRING MVC and SESAME set up and working out of the box. It also has some support functionality for easier querying the RDF store.

## Renaming the microservice

Steps needed to rename your microservice:
1. in the pom.xml replace the artifactId with the name your service will have.
2. in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml replace the display name.
3. in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml replace the servlet-name (2 locations!)
4. rename the java_template package
